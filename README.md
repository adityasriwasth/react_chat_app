A Chat App using React and socket.io

This chat application allows a user to enter a name of their choice and join a group of users. 

The chat has a sidebar that will list the number of users and enables private messaging.

If the app does not load, it might be because some of the node-modules packages are missing. To resolve this, just enter the directory and enter: npm install.

The App has a server side acting as the backend and the React component which is the frontend.
To run the backend, type in: npm run server
To run the React module, type in: npm run react
